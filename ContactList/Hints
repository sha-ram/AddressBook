ContactList
Create an application for managing a contact list. There are several kinds of contact and various kinds 
of information a contact can hold.
The user wants to store the contact information of:
Friends of the user
Family members
Businesses the user has a relationship with
Coworkers
Individual contacts within other businesses
They want to keep track of contact names, phone numbers, email addresses, postal addresses, birthdays, GST 
registration numbers, employers, employees, relationships, and notes. These pieces of information can change 
over time, and the user wants to be able to get a current report of applicable information for any contact 
after looking them up. 
They want to be able to explore the contacts: after viewing a contact, they should be able to move on easily
 to viewing one of their relatives or employees, or their employer. Contacts should be deletable, modifiable,
  and addable, and their interconnections should be changeable. The user interface can be either textual or 
  graphical, and you may include saving and loading to file if you wish.
Design and build an application to keep track of these contacts. You may want to use inheritance, 
interfaces, recursive methods, lists, and objects in your program. Consider how best to represent 
the data and behaviour you want to support, and if there are any particular elements you'd like to practice 
or revise, how you can work those in as well.
